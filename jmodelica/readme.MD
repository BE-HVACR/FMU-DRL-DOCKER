# jModelica source code

JModelica source code is hosted in https://github.com/JModelica/JModelica. 
But the codes are originally developed under Python 2. 
Although some codes have been modfied for Python 3, it will be a major project to fully support Python 3.

## Python 2 Version
JModelica in Python 2 is from an existing binary compiled before the open-source codes are removed for public access.
The current source code hosted in github cannote be compiled on local machine due to the lack of key numerical packages.

## Python 3 Version
Currently there are open-source jModelica in Python 3.
